It should be noted that development primarly is ongoing with the vNext release of Windows 11, and lower versions may be more broken than newer ones. Above table lists all Operating System versions ever released for ARM64 Processors. 1709, 1803 and 1809 are not supported due to being too old to support the Snapdragon™ 855 System on a Chip (SoC).
