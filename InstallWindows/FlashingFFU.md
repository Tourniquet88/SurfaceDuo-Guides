## What you will get üõí

You will end up with both Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows on your Surface Duo. Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows will both split the internal storage.

Android‚Ñ¢ will boot normally, and you will have to use a PC to boot Windows when needed, unless you create a dual boot image (explained later).

# Steps üõ†Ô∏è

## Unlocking the Bootloader

If not already done, please first proceed with the [Unlocking the Bootloader](UnlockingBootloader.md) guide for Surface Duo. Come back once you're done. If you already followed this guide, please skip the unlocking section.

## Acquiring all files

First, start by going to the [FFU Release Channel](https://t.me/DuoWOA_FFUs) on your computer.

![FFU-1-Chan](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/5e4a3551-0c9f-480c-9022-21214b4dc9fa)

Once on the page, click on "View in telegram". Please note due to FFU files being hosted on telegram, you will need a telegram account and application to access this resource. We do not currently make FFUs available on another website. If you do not have an account, register one.

Once viewed in telegram, scroll down til you see the FFU you want to download. In our example, we want to download the FFU File for Surface Duo (1st Gen) that maximizes all the storage space for Windows. You may want a different one for a different device or storage configuration. Pick wisely the file you want, the channel will include information to help you decide, as well as important information often for these images. Carefully read them and consider them while following this guide later on.

![FFU-2-Files](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/4fa7d0d0-7df3-4ae5-9bcc-d612be996368)

Start by downloading all the files of the FFU you want by clicking on both, and waiting til they're fully downloaded on your computer. You will know the files are downloading due to the spinning progress bar, and once complete, a filled file icon.

![FFU-3-DL](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/566048d9-600f-4401-9006-2db4c7c6327a)

Get 7-zip if you do not already have it and install it.

Then extract your FFU file out of the split archive you just downloaded using 7-zip by going to the download folder where the split archive is, right clicking, 7-zip, extract.

Once done, download the [FFU Tools](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/raw/main/InstallWindows/Files/FFU-Loader-Tools.zip) on your computer and save them. Please note these tools currently do not work on ARM64 Windows devices unfortunately. You will need an x86/x86_64 computer to flash a FFU file on your device for now.

![FFUTools-1-DL](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/af4683d1-8245-411b-bd51-99cb2c171551)

Now, go to the [latest release page](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Releases/releases/latest) of the drivers and UEFI for Surface Duo on your computer:

![ReleasePage-1-Top](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/6ab6495f-1c1b-47da-bd64-8a89fe80d901)

Please take some time to read the latest release notes, they may contain very important last minute information that you want to know. Once read, scroll down to the bottom:

![ReleasePage-2-Bottom](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/f175c4e1-ee2e-4b0b-8d48-798be939b1b8)

Now you got two outcomes:

- If you are flashing a FFU file for Windows 10X, or a FFU file for Windows 10 version 1909 or older, you want to download the Secure Boot disabled UEFI packages
- If you are flashing any other type of FFU, download the normal UEFI (Surface.Duo.1st.Gen.UEFI.Fast.Boot.zip/uefi.img or Surface.Duo.2.UEFI.Fast.Boot.zip/uefi.img)

Save the UEFI package on your computer and extract it.

We're done downloading everything needed to setup our device.

## Getting to FFU Loader

- Reboot into the Bootloader mode by running this command while inside Android‚Ñ¢:

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

![Surface Duo in Bootloader mode](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/eb19d500-4849-4ded-bd0c-894e4ac56486)
_Image of what you should see right now: Surface Duo in Bootloader mode_

- Start by booting the UEFI:

```batch
fastboot boot uefi.img
```

- Press the Volume Down Key on the side of your device til you see something like shown below on screen:

![Surface Duo in FFU Loader mode](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/f35ba53d-70c6-41de-9cca-ad31368a35fb)

Congratulations, you're now in FFU Loader.

## Flashing the Windows FFU Image

- Open a command prompt where you extracted the FFU-Loader-Tools archive, and run the following commands:

```batch
ImageUtility.exe FlashDevice -Path <Path to the FFU File you downloaded>
```

![Surface Duo in FFU Loader mode, flashing](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/7770ef0a-62d9-49de-a9b0-f8e4f3a58933)

- You should now see the device flashing on both your computer and on the device, wait til the process is complete. In case the PC complains the device was not found, try using an USB-2 port or cable that downgrades your connection to USB-2, there are known issues with the UEFI that prevent USB-3 from functioning properly at the moment, and will be addressed in a future update.

- Once done you should be seeing the following screen:

![Surface Duo in FFU Loader mode, flashed](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/ba3c33df-9eb5-4b21-90da-7b8b0c3a5faf)

- Now reboot the device, you should be back to the bootloader menu:

```batch
ImageUtility.exe RebootDevice
```

- In case the bootloader menu does not automatically come up, press the volume down when running above command to be 100% sure you go into the bootloader menu.

- Run the following two commands:

```batch
fastboot set_active other
fastboot set_active other
```

And reboot your device
```batch
fastboot reboot
```

## Reset Android‚Ñ¢

If this is your first time flashing this FFU file, or you're flashing a different storage or layout configuration image, you will lose all of your Android‚Ñ¢ data. Further more, you will also not have Android boot successfully.
If this isn't your case, feel free to ignore this section, Android‚Ñ¢ should still boot fine.
If this is your case, when booting Android‚Ñ¢, you will get notified Android cannot boot anymore. In this screen, you must select "Factory Reset" instead of "Try again" or else, Android‚Ñ¢ will refuse to boot again.

- You should now be seeing the Android‚Ñ¢ Out of Box Experience (OOBE). Setup your phone to confirm it works correctly.

![Android‚Ñ¢ - OOBE](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/5f86cbbe-df08-4ba6-92aa-b7fd2a7f72b3)

- Assuming your Surface Duo is booted to Android‚Ñ¢, plugged to your PC

- Using the Microsoft Launcher, find the settings app

- Press the Build number field 7 times consecutively, you should first start to see a popup after 3 taps

![A5 Android‚Ñ¢ - Settings About Down Tap Dev](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/b850bef7-2938-47a0-b781-c54178e3cf7d)

## Boot Windows üöÄ

We are ready to boot for the first time!

Let's boot the UEFI, from a command prompt:

```batch
fastboot boot uefi.img
```

This step above will be needed every time you will want to boot Windows and needs to be done from the Bootloader mode.

If you did everything right, Windows will now boot! Enjoy!

**Note:** If the Touch keyboard won't show up in OOBE, touch somewhere else (to let the text box loose focus) and then touch into the text box again. As an alternative, you can use the On-Screen Keyboard.

Let Windows set itself up, and come back once you're on the Windows Desktop on your Surface Duo

**Note 2:** If you get a BSOD (bugcheck screen) during initial setup, you can try erasing both the esp and win partitions using "fastboot erase esp" and "fastboot erase win", and reflash the FFU file, then it should work. This issue will get fixed in later FFU revisions.

## Boot Windows again after initial installation

You'll have two methods of booting Windows.

- Manual booting with a PC
    - Pros: You can freely update Android‚Ñ¢
    - Cons: You will need a PC to boot to Windows

- Enabling Dual Boot
    - Pros: You'll be able to boot Windows directly from the device
    - Cons: Every time you update Android‚Ñ¢, you'll have to follow [this guide](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md)

In case you want the dual boot option, then follow [this guide](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows/DualBoot.md)
