## Warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è

- Don't create partitions from Mass Storage Mode on Windows (because ABL will break with blank/spaces in names), your phone may be irrecoverable otherwise
- If you see a warning and/or error during the process, it is not normal. Contact us on telegram if you see anything odd, but do not continue or proceed on your own, you will break things further.
- Don't rerun the commands if you interrupt the process. You may break your partition table. Parted is a very *delicate* tool, anything you do may cause permanent damage to your device.
- Do not run all commands at once. Parted is a very *delicate* tool, anything you do may cause permanent damage to your device.
- Do not commit *any* typo with *any* commands. Parted is a very *delicate* tool, anything you do may cause permanent damage to your device.
- Be familiar with command line interfaces. Parted is a very *delicate* tool, anything you do may cause permanent damage to your device.
- When using TWRP, it is normal and expected for the phone to be detected as a Xiaomi phone and for touch to not work.

**THIS WILL WIPE ALL YOUR ANDROID‚Ñ¢ DATA**

We don't take any responsibility for any damage done to your phone. By following this guide, you agree to take full responsibility of your actions. We have done some testing,
but this is **STILL IN PREVIEW** and things can go wrong.

**PLEASE READ AND BE SURE TO UNDERSTAND THE ENTIRE GUIDE BEFORE STARTING**

## What you will get üõí

You will end up with both Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows on your Surface Duo. Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows will both split the internal storage (64GB and 64GB or 128GB and 128GB).

Android‚Ñ¢ will boot normally, and you will have to use a PC to boot Windows when needed, unless you create a dual boot image (explained later).

# Steps üõ†Ô∏è

## Unlocking the bootloader

- Backup all your data. **_You will lose everything you have on Android‚Ñ¢ and will start from scratch_**.

- In Android‚Ñ¢ settings, enable the Developer Settings menu (7 consecutive taps on Build Number), and turn on "OEM Unlock" and "USB Debugging" inside it.

Assuming your Surface Duo is booted to Android‚Ñ¢, plugged to your PC:

- Open a command prompt on your PC and run this command:
```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```
- You will be rebooted to Surface Duo's bootloader. From there:
```batch
fastboot flashing unlock
```

Your phone will wipe itself and reboot to the Out of Box Experience in Android‚Ñ¢ (OOBE). From then:

- In Android‚Ñ¢ settings, enable the Developer Settings menu (7 consecutive taps on Build Number), and turn on "USB debugging" inside it.

- Reboot back into the bootloader mode by running this command:

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

## Making the partitions
- Start by booting TWRP:

```batch
fastboot boot surfaceduo1-twrp.img
```

- Once inside TWRP, touch will not be working and the device will say it is locked. This is completely normal. Keep the phone plugged to your PC and do these commands ONE BY ONE WITH NO TYPO!:

```batch
adb shell "setenforce 0"
adb push <path to parted that was downloaded earlier> /sdcard/
adb shell "mv /sdcard/parted /sbin/parted && chmod 755 /sbin/parted"
adb shell
```

- Now we are issuing commands directly from inside Surface Duo using the PC.

### Dangerous section

Anything in this section is DANGEROUS and may PERMANENTLY damage your phone if you do any step wrong. Please carefully read all warnings and all instructions and make NO MISTAKE. Do not proceed if late at night or tired.

!!!! Warning reminder !!!!

‚ö†Ô∏è Do not run all commands at once, instead run them one by one

‚ö†Ô∏è DO NOT MAKE ANY TYPO! Parted is a *very* delicate tool, you MAY BREAK YOUR DEVICE PERMANENTLY WITH BELOW COMMANDS IF YOU DO THEM WRONG!

‚ö†Ô∏è If you see any warning, or error, it is not normal. Contact us on telegram

‚ö†Ô∏è You can kill things if you do below's steps wrong

<details>
  <summary>If you want a different allocation split between Windows and Android‚Ñ¢, you can do so. Just be aware of the following:</summary>
  <p>

```bash
notmkpart win ntfs <REDACTED FOR EXAMPLE PURPOSES> 57344MB
notmkpart userdata ext4 57344MB <REDACTED FOR EXAMPLE PURPOSES>
```

The commands above work like this:

[tool name] [partition name in gpt] [file system] [starting offset in disk] [ending offset in disk]

So if you want to change the split, all you have to do is to change the "57344MB" in above's example in both commands.

  </p>
</details>

- Let's run parted and make the partitions (ONE BY ONE WITH NO TYPO!):

```bash
setenforce 0
parted /dev/block/sda
print
```

**Make sure that the last partition listed is numbered 6. If it is not, below's commands may DESTROY your phone in a permanent manner**

Take note of original sizing, here it was 51.9MB -> 112GB (256GB variant: 51.9MB -> 240GB) and replace every occurence of 51.9MB and 112GB with your original sizing that *you noted down* (these may not differ, but if they do, replace them)

This will get you out of parted.

We have deleted partition 6, which was the Android‚Ñ¢ userdata partition, and created 3 partitions: an esp partition which will contain the Windows boot files,
a win partition that will have Windows, and the last one is the new userdata partition for Android‚Ñ¢, just smaller.

Now let's make these partitions actually usable:

```bash
setenforce 0
mkfs.fat -F32 -s1 /dev/block/sda6
mkfs.ntfs -f /dev/block/sda7
mke2fs -t ext4 /dev/block/sda8
exit
```

### End of the Dangerous section

## Going to Mass Storage

- Let's load the mass storage shell script in order to boot into Mass Storage from TWRP

```batch
adb shell "setenforce 0"
adb push <path to downloaded msc.tar> /sdcard/
adb shell "tar -xf /sdcard/msc.tar -C /sdcard --no-same-owner"
adb shell "sh /sdcard/msc.sh"
```

Surface Duo should now be in USB 3 SuperSpeed (or what the USB-IF currently calls it) Mass Storage Mode.

## Installing Windows

- Make sure you are in Mass Storage Mode, that your Surface Duo is plugged into your PC
- Mount the partitions you have created using diskpart and assign them some letters:

```batch
‚ö†Ô∏è THESE ARE NOT ALL COMMANDS. DISKPART COMMANDS VARY A LOT, SO THESE ARE SOME ROUGH INSTRUCTIONS.
ACTUAL COMMANDS START WITH AN HASHTAG (which you will need to remove)
YOU DO NOT HAVE TO USE Y or X, THEY ONLY NEED TO BE FREE LETTERS. IF LETTERS DONT ASSIGN FINE, USE ANOTHER ONE.
IF ONE PARTITION IS ALREADY ASSIGNED, YOU ALSO DO NOT NEED TO ASSIGN IT AGAIN IF YOU DONT WANT TO.

# list disk
Find the Surface Duo Disk, and take note of the number.
# select disk <number>
# list partition
You will be able to recognize the partitions we made earlier by their size. take note of the ESP and WIN partition numbers.
# select partition <esp-partition-number>
# assign letter=Y:
# select partition <win-partition-number>
# assign letter=X:
```

- You will have two partitions loaded, one is the ESP partition, and the other is the Win partition. Take note of the letters you've used.

**_‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: From now on we will assume X: is the Win partition and that Y: is the ESP partition for all the commands. Replace them correctly with what you previously picked or you will lose data on your PC._**

- We will need our install.wim file now. If you haven't it already, you can [use this guide](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/CreateWindowsISO.md). When you are ready, run these commands:

```batch
dism /apply-image /ImageFile:"<path to install.wim>" /index:1 /ApplyDir:X:\
```

This will take a bit of time. Go make some coffee ‚òï or some tea üçµ.

- Once that is done:

```batch
bcdboot X:\Windows /s Y: /f UEFI
```

Windows is now installed but has no drivers.

## Installing the drivers

- Extract the drivers, Extract driver updater, and from the command prompt in the DriverUpdater.exe directory:

```batch
DriverUpdater.exe -d "<path to extracted drivers>\definitions\Desktop\ARM64\Internal\epsilon.txt" -r "<path to extracted drivers>" -p X:\
```

- Once it is done, you can reboot your phone using ```adb reboot bootloader```. You will be able to boot to Android‚Ñ¢ and your phone will work normally. Set it up if you need it.

You will be back into Surface Duo's bootloader.

## Boot Windows üöÄ

We are ready to boot for the first time!

Reboot your device to fastboot, using adb or from the recovery.

Let's boot the UEFI, from a command prompt:

```batch
fastboot boot surfaceduo1-uefi.img
```

This step above will be needed every time you will want to boot Windows and needs to be done from the Bootloader mode.

If you did everything right, Windows will now boot! Enjoy!

**Note:** If the Touch keyboard won't show up in OOBE, touch somewhere else (to let the text box loose focus) and then touch into the text box again. As an alternative, you can use the On-Screen Keyboard.

Let Windows set itself up, and come back once you're on the Windows Desktop on your Surface Duo

## Boot Windows again after initial installation

You'll have two methods of booting Windows.

- Manual booting with a PC
    - Pros: You can freely update Android‚Ñ¢
    - Cons: You will need a PC to boot to Windows

- Enabling Dual Boot (Not recommended right now, advanced/experienced users only)
    - Pros: You'll be able to boot Windows directly from the device
    - Cons: Every time you update Android‚Ñ¢, you'll have to follow [this guide](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows/DualBoot-SurfaceDuo.md)

In case you want the dual boot option, then follow [this guide](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/blob/main/InstallWindows/DualBoot-SurfaceDuo.md)

## Additional Context and Notes

If you somehow break entirely your partition table, you might be interested in the original offsets of each partition in order to fix it.

```bash
mkpart ssd 6s 7s
mkpart persist ext4 8s 8199s
mkpart metadata ext4 8200s 12295s
mkpart frp 12296s 12423s
mkpart misc 12424s 12679s
```

The offsets are valid for both the Surface Duo (First Gen) 128GB model, and the Surface Duo (First Gen) 256GB model. They do not include userdata. You will have to recreate this yourself.

(NEVER RUN THESE COMMANDS IF YOU DO NOT NEED TO OR YOU ALREADY PARTITIONS IN PLACE, ADVANCED USERS ONLY, YOU MAY KILL YOUR PHONE HERE)
