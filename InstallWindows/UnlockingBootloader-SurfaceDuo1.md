## What you will get üõí

You will end up with both Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows on your Surface Duo. Android‚Ñ¢ and Windows will both split the internal storage (64GB and 64GB or 128GB and 128GB).

Android‚Ñ¢ will boot normally, and you will have to use a PC to boot Windows when needed, unless you create a dual boot image (explained later).

# Steps üõ†Ô∏è

## Unlocking the bootloader

- Backup all your data. **_You will lose everything you have on Android‚Ñ¢ and will start from scratch_**.

- In Android‚Ñ¢ settings, enable the Developer Settings menu (7 consecutive taps on Build Number), and turn on "OEM Unlock" and "USB Debugging" inside it.

Assuming your Surface Duo is booted to Android‚Ñ¢, plugged to your PC:

- Open a command prompt on your PC and run this command:
```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

You will be rebooted to Surface Duo's bootloader.

Your phone will wipe itself and reboot to the Out of Box Experience in Android‚Ñ¢ (OOBE). From there:

- In Android‚Ñ¢ settings, enable the Developer Settings menu (7 consecutive taps on Build Number), and turn on "USB debugging" inside it.
