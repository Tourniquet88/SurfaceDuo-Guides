## Steps üõ†Ô∏è

### Switching to Mass Storage Mode

- Start by booting TWRP:

For Surface Duo (1st Gen):

- Plug your phone to your PC, open a command prompt and start by typing the following text, but do not press enter just yet

```batch
fastboot boot
```

- Go find the surfaceduo1-twrp.img file you downloaded earlier, right click it, click "Copy as path"

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/3e8db3d5-44d0-4e6c-a7ef-674f86e82650)

- Then go back to the Command Prompt window we started writing text in previously, and simply, right click on it with your mouse (or long press if you're on a touch device), you should now see this:

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/e97d514b-a314-4faf-9622-75bdab066985)

- Now you can press enter

You will now boot to TWRP. Reminder that touch doesn't work on TWRP for now, so you'll have to work through your PC.

For Surface Duo 2:

- Plug your phone to your PC, open a command prompt and start by typing the following text, but do not press enter just yet

```batch
fastboot boot
```

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/24c5ed51-4710-449d-a5dc-686f8da8ea47)

- Go find the surfaceduo2-twrp.img file you downloaded earlier, right click it, click "Copy as path"

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/3e8db3d5-44d0-4e6c-a7ef-674f86e82650)

- Then go back to the Command Prompt window we started writing text in previously, and simply, right click on it with your mouse (or long press if you're on a touch device), you should now see this:

![image](https://github.com/WOA-Project/SurfaceDuo-Guides/assets/3755345/e97d514b-a314-4faf-9622-75bdab066985)

- Now you can press enter

You will now boot to TWRP. Reminder that touch doesn't work on TWRP for now, so you'll have to work through your PC.

---

- Once inside TWRP, touch will not be working and the device will say it is locked. This is completely normal. Keep the phone plugged to your PC and do these commands ONE BY ONE WITH NO TYPO!:

```batch
adb shell "setenforce 0"
adb push <path to downloaded msc.tar> /sdcard/
adb shell "tar -xf /sdcard/msc.tar -C /sdcard --no-same-owner"
adb shell "sh /sdcard/msc.sh"
```

## Updating Drivers

> [!WARNING]
> From now on we will assume X: is the Win partition for all commands. Replace them correctly with what you previously picked or you will lose data on your PC.

- Extract the driver package, extract the driver updater zip, and open a command prompt in the directory containing DriverUpdater.exe:

For Surface Duo (1st Gen):

```batch
DriverUpdater.exe -d "<path to extracted drivers>\definitions\Desktop\ARM64\Internal\epsilon.xml" -r "<path to extracted drivers>" -p X:\
```

For Surface Duo 2:

```batch
DriverUpdater.exe -d "<path to extracted drivers>\definitions\Desktop\ARM64\Internal\zeta.xml" -r "<path to extracted drivers>" -p X:\
```

---

- Once it is done, you can reboot your phone using:

```batch
adb reboot bootloader
```

You will be back into Surface Duo's bootloader.

```batch
fastboot boot uefi.img
```

- If you are in Android‚Ñ¢, boot into Surface Duo's bootloader using the following command:
